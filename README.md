IMDB Sentiment Analysis with RNN
This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. The dataset is preprocessed and tokenized, and the model is trained to predict sentiment based on the text of the reviews.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a simple RNN model to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset into two categories: positive and negative. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging the power of recurrent layers to understand the sequence of words in the reviews.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
